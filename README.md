# CBSD
Fork of OpenBSD (via simple examples) that patches problems with kernel relinking opening up undesirable regressions and local exploits, and that aims to provide a parallel build environment that's not self-hosted in OpenBSD and which also can be bootstrapped from the OpenBSD 7.3/amd64 release media easily with or without BSD make.
